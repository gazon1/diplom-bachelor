    abstract = { Abstract Many climate studies need to generate estimates of a climate variable at a given location based on values from other locations. In this research, a new method for the spatial interpolation of daily maximum surface air temperatures is presented. This new method uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) to generate temperature estimates at 11 locations given information from a lattice of surrounding locations. The out-of-sample performance of the ANNs is evaluated relative to a variety of benchmark methods (spatial average, nearest neighbor, and inverse distance methods). The ANN approach is superior both in terms of predictive accuracy and model encompassing. In 94\% of case comparisons, the predictive accuracy of the ANN is superior to the benchmark methods. The ANN approach encompasses the benchmark methods in 77\% of case comparisons, while benchmark methods encompass the ANN in only 2\%. In light of these results, the potential to use this new method of spatial interpolation to downscale GCM temperature simulations is discussed. }

abstract = "This paper utilizes artificial neural networks for the prediction of hourly mean values of ambient temperature 24 h in advance. Full year hourly values of ambient temperature are used to train a neural network model for a coastal location â€” Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. This neural network is trained off-line using back propagation and a batch learning scheme. The trained neural network is successfully tested on temperatures for years other than the one used for training. It requires only one temperature value as input to predict the temperature for the following day for the same hour. The predicted hourly temperature values are compared with the corresponding measured values. The mean percent deviation between the predicted and measured values is found to be 3.16, 4.17 and 2.83 for three different years. These results testify that the neural network can be a valuable tool for hourly temperature prediction in particular and other meteorological predictions in general."
